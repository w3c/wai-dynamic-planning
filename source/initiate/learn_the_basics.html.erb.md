{:.introduction}
The more you understand accessibility, the more effectively it can be implemented and promoted throughout your organization. Some ways to learn more about Web accessibility include:

*	reviewing introductory articles and videos;
*	talking with colleagues, friends, and family members with disabilities;
*	taking trainings appropriate for your particular role;
* working with disability organizations that offer training or information services.

First-hand experience of how people with disabilities use the web can be enlightening and inspiring. This can help convince others of the need for web accessibility. 

### What is accessibility?

Web content and services are accessible when they are equally available to all people regardless of disability. Web accessibility brings much broader benefits both to your organization and other website visitors. For example, visitors using mobile devices with smaller screens and older people with changing abilities due to aging benefit from accessible websites.
