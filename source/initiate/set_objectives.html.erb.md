{:.introduction}
Identify and set measurable objectives that respond to identified accessibility problems. Develop measurable objectives that address accessibility gaps within the organization's web content, processes, and policies. Objectives will help to focus your team, clarify what activities need to be planned, define required deliverables, and ensure that progress is successful.

Ensure that objectives have management agreement and support. This will help secure funding, align accessibility and business objectives, and reinforce your strategy. 

Examples objectives might include:

* Develop accessibility policy by year-end;
* Include accessibility clauses in procurement within 6 months and enforce for all new Web procurement activities by year-end;
* Evaluate primary website and address any Level A and AA non-conformancies within 18 months;
* Prepare and deliver accessible writing course for all content authors by May.
