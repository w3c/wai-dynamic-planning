{:.introduction}
Exploring the current state of accessibility in your organization will help in discussions with stakeholders and management. This will also provide you with a better understanding of the scale of the challenge.

Several aspects of web accessibility can be checked fairly easily, with little or no technical skills required. This includes cursory checks of:

* Key websites and user activities;
* Web content policies and processes, for example related to editing and publishing;
* General awareness of and attitude towards accessibility and disability.

You may not be in the position to explore all these aspects in a first attempt. However, the more information you can gather, the better you will understand the types and sources of the issues that need to be addressed.
