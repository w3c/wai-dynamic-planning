{:.introduction}
Communicate the importance and value of accessibility throughout your organization. Many people will know nothing about accessibility. Some may not appreciate that their role has an impact on website accessibility. Others may not be aware of the additional value that accessibility brings.

A general introduction to accessibility, including organizational goals, will benefit everyone in the organization. For specific teams, consider providing additional relevant information. For example, marketing may benefit from specific information on promoting corporate social responsibility.

Consider inviting guest or expert speakers to organizational or departmental events to talk about accessibility.
