{:.introduction}
Integrate the goals from your Accessibility Policy within other organizational procedures and policies. This will help spread the responsibility but also ensure that accessibility is considered as an integral part of day-to-day activities.

The following are some examples of where incorporating accessibility can bring broad benefits.

* Recruitment policies - include relevant accessibility skills in general recruitment briefs and policies, to support the recruitment of staff expertise.
* Staff training - provide accessibility training as part of staff and career development plans, to support the development of staff expertise.
* Document publishing process - incorporate accessibility checks as part of your web content publishing workflow, to ensure that good practice is maintained and that final web content continues to be accessible.
* Procurement process - ensure that suppliers are aware of your accessibility requirements by including criteria in any request for quotations and contracts.

Depending on your organization there may be several other relevant procedures or policies that involve accessibility, such as equal employment policies, workspace accommodation, and customer care.
